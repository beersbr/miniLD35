## Space Shooter Castle Defence ##

#### Design ####

* Bullets have gravity towards the bottom half of the screen... for some reason.
* Enemies Should not reach the left side of the screen as that's where the castle/homebase lives.
* Protect the castle for as long as possible fighting off waves of different enemy types.
